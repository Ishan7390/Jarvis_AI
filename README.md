# Jarvis_AI
This is my attempt at building a not so much of an AI, Jarvis
## About 
This .py script uses Google Calendar API to recieve info about calendar and then uses pyttsx3, an offline speech library to convey results and understand speech.

## Disclaimer
This is NOT an Artificial Intelligence, I have used conditionals to find, If a particular phrase exists in the speech, and then deliver particular results based on that.
### BUGS
Yes, There is a miniscule bug that doesn't allow the program to run properly, and I am unable to debug it.
Really Encourage anyone to try to debug and then send a pull request, will be very helpful.
